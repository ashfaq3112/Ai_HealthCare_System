# Cluster Profiles (KMeans)

- Silhouette Score: **0.1500**

### Cluster 0
This cluster is characterized by high-risk health indicators. The average age is the highest among all clusters (55.3 years), and this group has the highest mean values for hypertension (15.2%) and heart disease (11.2%). Their average glucose level is also significantly elevated (115.6), suggesting a patient population with multiple pre-existing conditions. This cluster represents a key group for targeted, high-priority care.

### Cluster 1
This cluster represents a large, moderate-risk patient group. They have a similar average age to Cluster 0 (53.8 years) but exhibit a slightly lower prevalence of heart disease (5.3%) and a lower average glucose level (108.4). This group could be ideal for proactive monitoring to prevent the progression of risk factors.

### Cluster 2
This cluster is defined by a low-risk profile. They have the lowest average age (17.3 years) and the lowest mean values for all major risk factors, including hypertension and heart disease. Their average BMI (24.1) and glucose levels (94.1) are also the lowest. This group could be targeted for preventative care and health education.
